<p>In this series of posts, <g class="gr_ gr_24 gr-alert gr_tiny sel gr_spell gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="24" data-gr-id="24">I</g> will attempt to give a basic understanding of what DevOps is and how it works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a lot of excitement around DevOps and how it can change the process of software development but there is a great deal of misinformation going around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>What is DevOps</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Software development lifecycle has seen <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">a lot of</g> changes over the years and although there is no perfect method many models have been proposed that claim to improve the efficiency and experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In traditional software development teams work in silos, with each team have different priorities. At the Core of DevOps is the goal to unite these teams in a way such that they share a common goal. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DevOps aims to unify development and operations to maximize <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="3" data-gr-id="3">the </g>efficiency of the <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">organisation</g>.</p>

<h2>Agile</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DevOps makes great use of agile methodologies along with scrum for development allowing for greater transparency and eliminating teams working solo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Concepts of agile like sprints, stand-up meetings etc are followed to keep the organisation in sync allowing pain points to be addressed and resolved much quicker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Automation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Automation plays a key role in DevOps, by eliminating repetitive manual tasks a lot of time is saved. Concepts like Continous Integration(CI) and Continous deployment(CD) allow for lesser development and deployment times. Testing which can potentially become a bottleneck is also automated as much as possible with minimum human interference so that the development isn't halted waiting for QA to clear it.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DevOps is not just a methodology or technology rather is a combination of both that allows for efficient software lifecycle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>I will be covering the details of DevOps implementation and more specific details in the subsequent posts.</p>
